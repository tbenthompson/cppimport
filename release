GIT:
git commit -m "yy.mm.dd" 
git tag -a 22.08.02 -m "22.08.02"
git push --atomic origin main yy.mm.dd
wait for github action to complete
create release on github

remaining tasks to automate in the publish CI workflow:
- publish to test pypi first
- then, check the published package
- then, republish to real pypi
- then, run the automatic release action.
